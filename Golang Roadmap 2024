## Contribution

The roadmap is built using [Draw.io](https://www.draw.io/). The roadmap file can be found for the beginner roadmap in the `./go-beginner/golang-beginner-roadmap.drawio.xml` file and the advanced roadmap  `./go-advanced/golang-advanced-roadmap.drawio.xml` file. To modify it, open draw.io, click **Open Existing Diagram**, and choose the `XML` file with the project. It will open the roadmap for you. Update it, upload and update the images in readme, and create a PR (export as PNG with 400% zoom and minify that with [Compressor.io](https://compressor.io/compress)).
